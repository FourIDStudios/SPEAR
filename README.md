# Agent-Based AI System

## Overview

This project explores the development of an **agent-based artificial intelligence system** designed to simulate agents interacting with their environment. These agents will perceive their surroundings, make decisions based on those perceptions, and adapt over time. The system will evolve from simple rule-based models to more sophisticated decision-making frameworks, such as utility-based AI, reinforcement learning (RL), and potentially genetic algorithms (GAs).

## Goals

The primary goal is to create agents that can:

- **Perceive**: Gather information from their environment.
- **Decide**: Make decisions based on their perceptions and internal needs.
- **Adapt**: Learn from their experiences and improve over time.

The system follows a standard AI pipeline:
- **Input** (Perception) → **Processing** (Decision-Making) → **Output** (Actions) → **Feedback** (Learning)

## Key Milestones

1. **Basic Rule-Based Agent**: An agent that transitions between predefined states with simple decision-making rules.
2. **Utility-Based Agent**: Agents choose actions based on the value of each potential outcome.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Q-Learning or Deep Q-Learning trained agents to enable longer-term optimization and learning.
4. **Genetic Algorithms (Optional)**: Evolving agents that improve over multiple generations, simulating human-like learning.

## Current Development Path

### Step 1: Foundation of the Agent System
We begin by defining the core components of the agent:

#### Agent Object
- **Attributes**: Hunger, energy, social needs, and other variables that influence the agent’s actions.
- **Genome**: Encodes genetic information that affects decision-making and agent behavior.
- **State Management**: Tracks the agent’s current state and potential actions to transition between states.
- **Perception**: A system to observe changes in the environment (e.g., detecting hunger or nearby threats).
- **Decision-Making**: Logic that allows the agent to choose the most appropriate action based on its current needs and environment.

#### Environment
Defines the world the agent operates in, including:
- **Resources**, **threats**, or **interactions with other agents**.
- Can be grid-based, event-driven, or dynamically generated based on certain conditions.

### Step 2: Implementing Simple AI

We will start by creating simple AI models:

#### Rule-Based AI
- The agent follows basic predefined rules (e.g., “if hunger is high, move to eat”).
- Simple state transitions without the ability to adapt or plan ahead.

#### Utility-Based AI
- Actions are evaluated based on the agent's internal needs (e.g., energy, hunger, or safety).
- The agent will execute the highest-value action according to its current state.
- Introduces a basic form of decision-making based on priorities.

### Step 3: Learning Mechanisms

Once basic AI is functional, we will move to learning systems:

#### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Train agents using a reward-punishment system to reinforce positive behaviors and discourage negative ones.
- Use Q-Learning or basic RL algorithms where agents learn to associate actions with rewards or penalties.
- Example: Reward eating when hungry, penalize starvation.

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning (Optional)
- Once basic RL setup is successful, extend it to deep RL, where agents use neural networks to learn and adapt in more complex environments.

### Step 4: Genetic Algorithms (Stretch Goal)

If time and resources allow, genetic algorithms (GAs) will be explored as an advanced method of evolving agents:

#### Genetic Algorithms
- Evolving agents over multiple generations.
- Agents “mate” based on fitness, and mutations introduce diversity into the population.
- Aims to simulate a more biological form of learning, offering long-term adaptation strategies.

## Features

- **Modular Agent Design**: Independent modules for states, actions, and decision-making, allowing for easy swaps as agent intelligence increases.
- **Dynamic State Management**: Agents evaluate and transition between states based on their internal needs and environment. Transition logic changes as more advanced AI systems (utility-based, RL) are introduced.
- **Adaptive Learning**: The system will include feedback mechanisms to allow agents to learn from experiences, considering both short-term rewards and long-term optimization goals.
- **Flexible Genome System**: Genetic traits influence agent decision-making and behavior. Potential for evolving agents over time with GAs.

## Planned Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Gradually introduce RL techniques to improve agent behavior over time.
- **Deep Q-Learning**: Implement deep reinforcement learning for more complex decision-making.
- **Visualization Tools**: Real-time visualization of agent behavior, decision-making, and adaptation.
- **Adaptive Environments**: Integrate dynamic environmental changes or random events to challenge agents and test adaptability.
